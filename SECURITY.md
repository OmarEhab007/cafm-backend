# Security Policy

## 🛡️ Security Overview

The CAFM Backend is an enterprise-grade facility management system built with security as a core principle. We take the security of our software seriously and appreciate your help in keeping it secure.

## 📋 Supported Versions

We actively maintain security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | ✅ Yes            |
| < 1.0   | ❌ No             |

## 🚨 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow our responsible disclosure policy:

### 🔴 For Critical/High Severity Issues
- **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
- Email us directly at: **[security@yourdomain.com]**
- Include "CAFM Security Vulnerability" in the subject line
- **Response Time**: We aim to acknowledge within 24 hours

### 🟡 For Medium/Low Severity Issues
- Create a [Security Advisory](https://github.com/your-org/cafm-backend/security/advisories/new)
- Or email us at: **[security@yourdomain.com]**
- **Response Time**: We aim to respond within 72 hours

### 📋 What to Include in Your Report

Please provide as much information as possible:

- **Vulnerability Type** (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS, Authentication Bypass)
- **Affected Components** (API endpoints, authentication system, etc.)
- **Steps to Reproduce** (detailed step-by-step instructions)
- **Impact Assessment** (potential damage, data exposure, etc.)
- **Proof of Concept** (code, screenshots, or demonstration)
- **Suggested Fix** (if you have recommendations)
- **Your Contact Information** (for follow-up questions)

## 🏆 Security Features

### 🔐 Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT-based Authentication** with secure token generation
- **Multi-tenant Architecture** with company-based data isolation
- **Role-based Access Control** (ADMIN, SUPERVISOR, TECHNICIAN)
- **Rate Limiting** to prevent brute force attacks
- **Session Management** with configurable timeouts

### 🛡️ Data Protection
- **Password Security**: BCrypt hashing with configurable strength
- **Environment Variable Protection**: All secrets externalized
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries only
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive Bean Validation
- **Output Encoding**: Proper response sanitization

### 🔒 Infrastructure Security
- **HTTPS Enforcement** in production environments
- **Security Headers**: CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.
- **CORS Configuration**: Strict origin controls
- **Database Security**: Connection pooling and prepared statements
- **Docker Security**: Non-root container execution

### 📊 Monitoring & Auditing
- **Comprehensive Audit Logging**: All security events tracked
- **Request Correlation**: Unique request IDs for traceability
- **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in metrics and health checks
- **Error Handling**: Structured error responses without information disclosure

## ⚠️ Security Considerations

### 🔐 Environment Configuration
- **Never commit secrets** to version control
- **Use strong passwords** (minimum 16 characters with complexity)
- **JWT secrets** must be at least 256 bits (32 characters)
- **Rotate credentials** regularly in production
- **Use TLS 1.2+** for all external communications

### 🏗️ Deployment Security
- **Environment Isolation**: Separate dev/staging/production environments
- **Network Segmentation**: Restrict database access
- **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies and base images current
- **Backup Security**: Encrypt backups and limit access
- **Monitoring**: Enable security event monitoring

### 👥 Development Security
- **Code Reviews**: All changes require review
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular vulnerability assessments
- **Static Analysis**: Automated security scanning
- **Test Security**: No production data in test environments
- **Access Control**: Principle of least privilege

## 🔧 Security Configuration

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
# Critical Security Variables (MUST be set)
JWT_SECRET=your_256_bit_secret_here
DB_PASSWORD=your_secure_database_password
REDIS_PASSWORD=your_secure_redis_password
MINIO_SECRET_KEY=your_secure_minio_secret

# Optional but Recommended
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://yourdomain.com
RATE_LIMIT_RPM=60
SESSION_TIMEOUT=30m
```

### Production Security Checklist
- [ ] All secrets configured via environment variables
- [ ] JWT secret is 256+ bits and randomly generated
- [ ] Database credentials use strong passwords
- [ ] CORS origins are explicitly configured
- [ ] Rate limiting is enabled
- [ ] Debug endpoints are disabled (`SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=prod`)
- [ ] HTTPS is enforced
- [ ] Security headers are configured
- [ ] Database connections are encrypted
- [ ] Regular backups are encrypted
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting are configured

## 🔍 Security Testing

### Automated Security Scanning
We employ multiple layers of security testing:
- **Dependency Vulnerability Scanning** (Dependabot)
- **Static Code Analysis** (SonarQube, CodeQL)
- **Container Scanning** (Docker security scanning)
- **API Security Testing** (OWASP ZAP)

### Manual Security Reviews
- Code reviews focus on security implications
- Regular architecture security reviews
- Penetration testing on staging environments
- Security audit before major releases
